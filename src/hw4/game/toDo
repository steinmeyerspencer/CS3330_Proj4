Need to make a createRandomGrid() function that uses some library to create a random number between 1-n where n is the passed parameter
Will need to set all left side cells to have wall in Cell['left'] and the opposite for right side cells, same for up and down
Besides this, will only need to randomize exit and then edit the surrounding cells appropriately
- Also checks if n is between 3-7, and if not, returns null


Also need another Game constructor where if an int is passed, it looks like this
public Game(int size) {
		this.grid = new createRandomGrid(size);
	}
